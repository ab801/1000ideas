# An online wishlist with real time alerting system

A website or an app where you can bookmark items from different websites. The website can monitor amazon, ebay, etc... In order to alert the user **within seconds** when the item is discounted

### PROs

* Useful for users, easy word of mouth
* Can be easily monetized with affiliation programs or different range of alerting subscriptions
* Nice tech challenge
* I'm not aware of real time alerting out there for shopping...
* Ecommerce is an expanding market

### CONs

* Platforms to be monitored are so many!
* Needs partnership with ecommerce giants
* Technical challenge is nice, but not easy for a single dev
* There are already well established competitors like CamelCamelCamel
* Localization, scaling, etc... Can be hard
